<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was designed with the intention to make increasing personal and business cyber security more interactive and clear cut. The Security Mountain lays out discrete steps and individual tasks to increase the users security as they move up the mountain, covering all areas of cyber security. This project has removed repeated tasks such as maintaining logs (for businesses) and has focused on achievable, impactful tasks to lay a good security foundation. 

### Built With
I have put Bootstrap in here as a template for the rest of the tools, which need adding. Please see MARKDOWN LINKS & IMAGES for placing specific urls etc.
